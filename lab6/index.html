	<p>Challenge</p>
	</div>

	<br>

	<p>In this lab we had to use basic JavaScript in the console and then use document.writeln to output the sources.
	 We also had to use arrays to hold our ordered lists and use objects for things like arrays, dates, and other functions.</p>

	<br>

	<p>Problems</p>

	<br>

	<p>I had some problems with the JavaScript and the document.writeln, but after some review I was able to
	figure it out. </p>

	<br>

	<p>Results:</p>

	<br>

	<div id="script">
					<h2>Script Output</h2>
					<script src="js/lab6.js"></script>
	</div>
