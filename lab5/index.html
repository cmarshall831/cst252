	<p>Challenge</p>
</div>

	<br>

	<p>In this lab we had to use basic JavaScript and comment blocks. We also had to use
	commands to get the results of the variables that we put in.</p>

	<br>

	<p>Problems</p>

	<br>

	<p>I had some problems with the JavaScript and understanding how to do the comment block,
	but after I looked back at notes I think I was able to figure it all out</p>

	<br>

	<p>Results:</p>

	<br>

	<div id="script">
	        <h2>Script Output</h2>
	        <script src="js/lab5.js"></script>
	</div>
