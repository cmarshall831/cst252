	<h1>Lab 3: File Structure and File Transfer</h1>

</div id="text">
	<p>In this lab we learned how to transfer files, create new files, and organize our files.
	we also learned how they are strucutred in order to work. I did not face any difficulties with this lab.
The result can be seen here - how my page looks clean, organized, and well put together because I knew where
my files were and they are structured correctly.</p>
